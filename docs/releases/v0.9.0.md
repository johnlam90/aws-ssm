# v0.9.0 Release Notes

_Release date: 2025-11-14_

## Highlights

- **Performance-focused refresh** – the new cache backend, AWS client pool, and streaming helpers drastically reduce redundant API calls and keep frequently used instance data warm.
- **Full-fidelity integration suites** – ASG, Session, EKS, and Cache commands now have realistic integration coverage that mirrors user flows and catches behavioural regressions before shipping.
- **Operational visibility** – new metrics helpers and documentation make it easier to observe command usage, track cache health, and validate scaling workflows in production-like environments.

## Detailed Changes

### Integration & Testing

- Added dedicated integration tests for `session`, `asg`, `cache`, and `eks` commands covering interactive selection, direct CLI parameters, confirmation flows, and error paths.
- Introduced a reusable test framework (`pkg/testing`) with structured assertions and timing helpers, enabling the suites to validate concurrency-sensitive behaviour like cache cleanup SLAs.
- Updated `make verify` defaults to run the new suites so contributors exercise the same flows as CI.

### Performance & Caching

- Implemented `cache_enhanced` with region/query-aware keys, cache statistics, and aggressive cleanup routines to keep disk usage predictable.
- Documented measurement approaches in `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`, including storage, lookup, and cleanup benchmarks plus reproducible steps.
- Added cache service metrics and logging so operational dashboards can surface hit rates, stale entries, and cleanup durations.

### AWS Client Improvements

- Added an AWS client pool and streaming helpers to reuse SDK connections while iterating over large instance sets, reducing throttle risks.
- Captured metrics for AWS API usage (rate limits, latency) to inform future optimizations or alerting.
- Hardened session and scaling flows with better validation (region/profile fallbacks, desired/min/max reconciliation, confirmation prompts).

### Documentation

- Refreshed `docs/README.md`, `docs/TESTING.md`, and `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` references to call out `make verify`, integration coverage, and performance profiling expectations.
- Added the `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` playbook so teams can repeat throughput and latency measurements before major changes.

## Upgrade Notes

- No breaking CLI flags or configuration schema changes. Existing config files remain valid.
- To benefit from the performance improvements, rebuild the binary (`make build`) or download the v0.9.0 artifacts from GitHub Releases.
- Run `make verify` locally before contributing – it now executes the expanded integration suites and ensures cache timing guarantees remain intact.

## Verification

The following command sequence was used when preparing v0.9.0:

```bash
make verify
```

This runs formatting, `go vet`, `golangci-lint`, and all unit + integration tests.
